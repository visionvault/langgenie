LangGenie: Langchain Q/A assistant

By now, most of you might have heard this phrase: "Generative AI is going to shape our future". Ever wondered how? LangGenie might give you a sneak peek!

What is LangChain?

LangChain is a powerful framework for crafting AI-native applications. It offers an amazing set of features, from interfacing with language models to persisting application state and integrating with external tools like Supabase and Zapier. It's no less than a game-changer in the AI field!

Can I ask an LLM questions about LangChain?

Nope. Most of the LLMs do not know about Langchain as their knowledge cut-off date is before the availability of this framework. Wouldn't it be awesome if we can somehow pass on the Langchain documentation to an LLM and ask questions about possible usecases?

Is this where LangGenie comes in?

Precisely! LangGenie is an application that is built using a simple yet efficient process: parsing LangChain's documentation, tokenizing the parsed content, generating token embeddings, and indexing these embeddings in Pinecone's vector database. It leverages LangChain's RetrievalQA prompt chain to carry out a semantic search on user queries and formulate a response with a pre-trained LLM model. Simple, right?

What's more? This assistant is a practical solution that can immensely aid in building real-world applications using LangChain. Whether you're a novice trying to grasp the basics or a veteran engineer looking for a quick reference, LangGenie simplifies your product-building journey, saving your time and energy that you can invest in creating something extraordinary.
